                  "example_explanation": "Let's suppose we have three different objects and we want to order them.",
                  "first_order": "This could be a way of doing it:",
                  "second_order": "But if we wanted to, we could also order them in the following way:",

                  "second_example": "Following our example, in this case the population (n) would be 3, because it is the total number of different objects which we dispose. On the other hand, the sample number (r) would also be 3, because in order to form distinct combinations, we are using all of our available objects.",
                  "what_method": "Is the order of my elements important? Will I use all of my elements? Asking ourselves these questions is important and it will help us define which method we should use.",

                  "order_example": "They are different because what we are evaluating is the order of the objects, although they are always the same ones. Therefore, order is important.",
                  "repetition_concept": "Methods with repetition in a set are the differents forms in which we can arrange a selection of elements of a given group, allowing selections to be repeated.",
                  "repetition_example": "Once we have already decided whether we are going to use combination, permutation or variation, we must ask ourselves if our elements can or not, be repeated. In our previous example, we could suppose that we only have one copy of each one and it is impossible for us to increment its quantity. Therefore, our elements can not be repeated."
